## Introduction

## Data Description

## Dimension Reduction

## K-Means Clustering

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
plt_true + plt_km_stats + plot_layout(ncol = 2)
```

## Clustering Accuracies

```{r}
combined_table
```

## Cluster Assignments for Stats Data
```{r, out.width="105%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/clustering_assignments_stats.png")
```

## Cluster Assignments for Image Data
```{r, out.width="105%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/clustering_assignments_imgs.png")
```

## Clustering Takeaways

- Stats cluster primary types better than images
  - at best clustering classified 52% of Pokemon type

- Limitations include imbalanced data among Pokemon types, which can be accounted for in Supervised Models

- Structure of the data may not capture the complexity of the Pokemon types in a way that creates efficient and distinct clusters

## Supervised Model

## Results
